# Pega-YUI

This repository serves as the primary development location for Pega-YUI library that is a modified and forked version of Yahoo's User Interface library (YUI) 2.x. Pega uses YUI as the basis of its UI engine. Pega forked YUI within the product to meet functional and security-related needs as gaps were discovered.

Pega engineering team has mitigated risks related to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Hijacking.  Pega software has successfully undergone penetration tests performed by clients and performed by the Pega Security team.  All issues identified were promptly fixed within Pega software.
